Imagine you have a superpower to do lots of things at the same time. That's what 'parallel function calling' is like. It means a computer can ask for different pieces of information, like the weather in three cities, all at once, instead of one by one. This makes everything much faster! When the computer gets the answers, it can tell you all three weather reports quickly. If you tell the computer exactly what to do, like checking the weather, it will do just that. Or, you can let it decide what's best to do next, like a choose-your-own-adventure game.
